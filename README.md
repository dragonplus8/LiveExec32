# LiveExec32
Run 32-bit binaries on 64-bit iOS by passing through syscalls.

Not all apps will work and will mostly run into missing symbols issue. Please open an issue for that.

This project is heavily based on [unidbg](https://github.com/zhkl0228/unidbg).

There are also missing syscalls that I have yet to provide to pass through. Please see [ARM32SyscallHandler.java](https://github.com/zhkl0228/unidbg/blob/master/unidbg-ios/src/main/java/com/github/unidbg/ios/ARM32SyscallHandler.java) and [DarwinSyscallHandler.java](https://github.com/zhkl0228/unidbg/blob/master/unidbg-ios/src/main/java/com/github/unidbg/ios/DarwinSyscallHandler.java) to implement them properly.

## Usage
- Initialize Dynarmic, then compile this project using Theos:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
gmake
```
  The host build configures Dynarmic automatically with CMake and links its
  static libraries into `LiveExec32Shared`. This requires CMake and Boost
  1.57 or newer on the build machine.
  For local execution tests on macOS, use
  `gmake LC32_BUILD_CATALYST=1`. This opt-in mode rewrites and re-signs only
  the assembled app and its embedded frameworks for Catalyst; a subsequent
  plain `gmake` restores normal iOS artifacts without requiring `clean`.
- Generate the guest Objective-C shims, then build the guest frameworks:
```bash
gmake -C GuestMakefile generate-shims
gmake -C GuestMakefile
```
  With GNU Make 4.3 or newer, independent frameworks and their source files are
  built through the shared jobserver; pass `-jN` to cap concurrency. Guest
  frameworks also share the SDK's MRC/ARC Clang module contexts, keeping a
  cold module cache compact. Set `LC32_SHARE_GUEST_MODULE_CACHE=0` only when
  diagnosing an isolated Clang module-cache issue.

  The guest build downloads the third-party iOS 10.3 SDK archive to
  `tmp/iPhoneOS10.3.sdk.tar.gz`, verifies its pinned SHA-256 checksum, and
  extracts it atomically to `tmp/iPhoneOS10.3.sdk` for subsequent builds. Set
  `ISYSROOT=/path/to/iPhoneOS10.3.sdk` to use an SDK obtained elsewhere, or
  override `LC32_GUEST_SDK_URL` and `LC32_GUEST_SDK_SHA256` together when
  using another mirror. The archive is hosted by a third party and remains
  subject to Apple's SDK terms. Run `gmake -C GuestMakefile sdk` to prefetch
  it without building. Theos still needs its separate iPhoneOS 16.5 SDK to
  link the project.

  The same build also downloads and verifies Apple's `libiconv-50` source at
  commit `6bcfda8c4720659e855c04ce72a8335fb4a67b0b`, then builds the armv7s
  `/usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib` used by older apps. The source and archive are
  cached under `tmp/`; run `gmake -C GuestMakefile libiconv` to build only
  that library. This library remains covered by the LGPL license shipped in
  Apple's source archive; the guest root includes that license at
  `/usr/local/OpenSourceLicenses/libiconv.txt`.
- Set up the guest root filesystem and install the built shim frameworks:
```bash
./GuestMakefile/pack-ramdisk.sh
```
  On the first run this downloads the iOS 10.3.3 restore ramdisk component
  (`058-75249-062.dmg`) from Apple's IPSW, verifies its pinned checksum,
  extracts its Img3 payload, and copies it into `Resources/RootFS` with
  `rsync -aH` (7z would break the HFS symlinks and dylib hardlink pairs that
  the guest dyld relies on). The download and extracted image are cached
  under `tmp/ipsw/`, so subsequent runs only reinstall the rebuilt
  frameworks.

  Override the sources with `RAMDISK_IPSW_URL`, `RAMDISK_IPSW_COMPONENT`,
  `RAMDISK_IPSW_COMPONENT_SHA256`, `RAMDISK_IMAGE_SHA256`,
  `RAMDISK_SETUP_DIR`, and `RAMDISK_ROOT`. Framework bundle metadata is
  tracked under `GuestMakefile/FrameworkInfoPlists`; override that snapshot
  with `FRAMEWORK_INFO_ROOT`, or set `IOS_SYSTEM_ROOT` to test against another
  mounted system image. Requires `pzb`, Python 3, `hdiutil`, and `rsync`.

- Launch a binary and profit.
```bash
.theos/obj/LiveExec32.app/LiveExec32 /var/mobile/ramdisk32/usr/bin/fdisk
```

Host environment variables are isolated from the guest by default. To pass a
specific value, prefix its name with `LC32_GUEST_ENV_`; the launcher strips
that prefix when constructing the guest environment. For example:

```bash
LC32_GUEST_ENV_NSUnbufferedIO=YES \
  .theos/obj/LiveExec32.app/LiveExec32 /var/mobile/ramdisk32/usr/bin/fdisk
```

`HOME`, `LC32_OBJC_TRACE`, `NATIVE_GUEST_THREADS`, and
`DYLD_SHARED_REGION` remain launcher-owned and cannot be overridden through
this mechanism. `DYLD_PRINT_*` diagnostics are disabled by default, but can
be enabled explicitly, for example with
`LC32_GUEST_ENV_DYLD_PRINT_SEGMENTS=1`.

## Design
- LiveExec32 has most of the codebase and references from [unidbg](https://github.com/zhkl0228/unidbg), so it also uses Dynarmic as the dynamic translator of ARMv7 code to ARM64.
- The entry point starts from dyld, so it has all of dyld APIs isolated from that of host.
- In `CallSVC`, it goes through a long list of guest functions that copy memory regions from input and to output using a page table. Perhaps page bound checks can be added to allow fastpath memory access.
- Has a crash reporter and symbolicator for guest code.
- Can emulate bind mount points
- More to be explored...

### Guest framework sources

Hand-written guest framework code lives in `GuestFrameworks/<Framework>` and
is tracked. `GuestFrameworks/.generated/<Framework>` is recreated by
`GuestMakefile/generate-shims.sh` and is intentionally ignored; do not commit
files from it. The generator currently obtains 12 private UIKit fallback
classes from the installed Catalyst runtime, so those particular shims remain
host-dependent until their iOS 10 signatures are captured in the tracked
templates.

## FAQ
### Can this be used to run 32-bit apps & integrate to LiveContainer?
Yes. The bundled Dynarmic revision includes the dual-mapping/TXM JIT path
required by iOS 26+, while non-iOS hosts remain single-mapped by default.

### Will this be available as a jailbreak tweak?
Yes eta now. During install, LiveExec32 shim is injected to the pending 32-bit
app so installd doesn't reject it and makes everything easier to handle.

## Will this allow running encrypted 32-bit apps (ie directly installed from App Store)?
Idk, need to research into this next
