These are the framework bundle metadata files used when assembling the guest
root filesystem. They were copied from the iOS 10.3.3 (14G60) system image
and converted to XML so clean builds do not require that multi-gigabyte image
to be mounted.

`pack-ramdisk.sh` still supports `IOS_SYSTEM_ROOT` as an explicit override for
refreshing or testing metadata from another mounted system image. Set
`FRAMEWORK_INFO_ROOT` to use another metadata snapshot without mounting an
image.

`CoreVideo.plist` is minimal generated compatibility metadata rather than an
Apple metadata snapshot. Its bundle versions use the current dylib version
1.5.0 read from the extracted iOS 10.3.3 CoreVideo image; the guest build also
preserves that image's 1.2.0 compatibility version. No Apple build provenance
is asserted for this generated plist.
